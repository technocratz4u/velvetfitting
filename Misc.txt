----------------------------SEO-TODOs------------------------------------
1. Make sure the 301 redirect is happening from non-www to www verion of the website properly. In our case php redirection is being used since htaccess has some other rewrite rules which seem to conflict with 301 redirect.
2. Leverage Browser Caching for Web Resources using htaccess. Also to use this feature, the mod_expires module of Apache is to be enable in local using “sudo a2enmod expires”. To check if the module has been enabled, go to phpinfo.php and see that mod_expires module is listed in the loaded modules section.
3. Use rel=”canonical” with the preferred www version for each page to avoid duplicate content.
4. For searched pages using Ids like http://ubuntu-vbox/category/<name>/<id>, make sure the rel=canonical is formed properly.
5. For searched pages missing Ids like http://ubuntu-vbox/category/<name>, try to 301 redirect to a proper url.
6. Add <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> to pages which you dont want to index.


Ensure the heading tags are placed properly in the pages as per the flow of the page
